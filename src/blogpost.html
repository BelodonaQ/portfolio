  <h6>Behind-the-Scenes Battles of Gaming Titans</h6>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">As the fascinating court drama unfolds between Microsoft and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over Microsoft's proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard, a couple of unexpected nuggets have popped up about the dynamics between some major players in the gaming world, namely Microsoft, Sony, Bethesda Game Studios, Activision Blizzard, and a few others. It seems like Microsoft and Sony have been playing a secret game of tug-of-war over exclusive rights to some iconic gaming titles for quite some time now.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Sony and the FTC have been major roadblocks in Microsoft's quest to bag Activision Blizzard for a cool $69 billion, mainly due to concerns about exclusivity. Ever since Microsoft spilled the beans about the proposed deal in early 2022, Sony's been voicing worries that their rival might give the PlayStation versions of Activision's star-studded Call of Duty franchise the cold shoulder, even though Microsoft has been repeatedly saying they'd do no such thing. But as testimonies emerge, the situation appears to be quite a tangled web.</p>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">
    An interesting twist came early on during the hearings. It turns out that Sony's fears about Call of Duty exclusivity may not have been completely honest. An email that saw the light of day just a few moments into the proceedings revealed that Jim Ryan, the big boss at PlayStation, never really sweated over the idea of the franchise becoming a Microsoft exclusive. He expressed his belief that the big-selling title would continue to land on PlayStation consoles for a good long while yet.
    
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Microsoft has publicly committed several times that they'd let Activision Blizzard keep churning out Call of Duty for PlayStation 5 and any PlayStation consoles that might follow after the acquisition. But Jim Ryan threw a spanner in the works during the hearing, casting doubt on how long that arrangement might last. He hinted that Sony might decide to stop providing next-gen PlayStation development kits to Microsoft's subsidiaries.</p>

  <h6></h6>

  
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Phil Spencer, the chief at Xbox, hinted that this policy of Sony's might already be keeping Microsoft-owned studios from giving their full support to PlayStation. However, there might be a touch of doubt over whether this claim is rock solid.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">After all, when Microsoft bought over the studio behind the blockbuster Minecraft, Mojang, they didn't halt development for competitor platforms such as PlayStation, Nintendo, and Apple. The game has continued to rock those platforms without a hitch. But Phil Spencer dropped a bit of a bombshell, revealing that they couldn't fully tune the game for the PS5 because they didn't have the right development kits.</p>
  <h6>Gaming's Grand Saga</h6>
  <p class="border Post-paragraph">Seems like we're knee-deep in a game of thrones, with consoles in place of kingdoms! Only time will reveal how this all plays out. Besides Call of Duty, the game that might really put Microsoft's multiplatform release strategy to the test is Bethesda's much-anticipated title, The Elder Scrolls VI. But when asked at the hearing, Phil Spencer played his cards close to his chest. He didn't spill the beans about which platforms the game will grace first, saying that it's too soon to dive into those details since the game's launch is at least half a decade away. And he hinted that which platforms the game ends up on might hinge on whether Microsoft can get its hands on development tools for the successor to the PS5.</p>
  
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Beyond the game of exclusive rights, another key theme of this court saga is Microsoft's stronghold in the budding cloud gaming market. Interestingly, it's this cloud dominance that led the UK's Competition and Markets Authority to withhold its blessing for the acquisition. This legal battle is certainly turning into an epic tale of its own, isn't it? Can't wait to see what the next chapter brings!</p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph"> In an attempt to soothe these worries, Microsoft has taken steps to show they're not all about keeping their games to themselves. They've made deals to offer their games on various other cloud services to underscore the point that they wouldn't lock Call of Duty into being an Xbox Cloud gaming exclusive. In fact, Microsoft has been quite modest about the whole cloud business, continuing to downplay its significance. It seems like they're trying to put everyone's mind at ease that it's not about dominating the market, but rather about giving gamers the best possible experience. Let's see how this strategy pans out!</p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Sarah Bond, the Head of Xbox Creator Experience, added another layer to the narrative during a cross-examination. She shared that cloud gaming is not exactly the crowning jewel of Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service. Even though some foresee cloud gaming carving out its own significant niche in the gaming market, Bond implied that it's more like a nice bonus feature in the existing console landscape. She mentioned that subscribers primarily use it to stream games on their console while they're waiting for the non-streaming versions to wrap up their installation process.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Probably the most surprising move from Microsoft, who's clearly not short of cash with their ability to shell out $69 billion for another company, was their admission in court that they've been trailing behind in the "console wars." Having stepped into the console market over two decades ago, Xbox consoles have typically found themselves in the third spot, behind the PlayStation and Nintendo systems. This recent statement is likely a strategic move to suggest that even with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, they wouldn't suddenly wield an unfairly large amount of market power. It's quite the intriguing strategy, isn't it? Let's see how this unfolds in the coming days!</p>
  <br>
  <p class="Post-paragraph">Now, here's a significant cliffhanger. If the court decides to grant the injunction requested by the FTC, it would throw a real spanner in the works for Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. They wouldn't be able to seal the deal until after the FTC's antitrust hearing slated for August 2. This situation would overshoot the acquisition contract's original deadline of July 18, and there's a chance it could end up derailing the entire purchase.</p>
